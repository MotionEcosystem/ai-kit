## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Key Management**: Never hardcode private keys
2. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
3. **Gas Limits**: Set appropriate gas limits for transactions
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper permission checks

### For Users

1. **Wallet Security**: Use hardware wallets for valuable assets
2. **Phishing Protection**: Always verify website URLs
3. **Transaction Review**: Carefully review all transactions
4. **Software Updates**: Keep SDK and tools updated
5. **Private Key Safety**: Never share private keys
